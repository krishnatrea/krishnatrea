I’m Harshit Sharma, a developer from Delhi, India, and I’m the kind of person who loves to look at a problem, roll up my sleeves, and turn it into a working solution—preferably without breaking anything in the process (but no promises).

I’m all about creating things that actually work. Whether it’s a small bug or a big, gnarly issue, I love taking it apart and putting it back together in a way that makes sense. Think of me as a tech detective—finding the culprit, solving the mystery, and leaving everything in working order.

Right now, I’m all in on backend development, figuring out how to build systems that don’t just work but work really well, even when things get crazy. It's like building a sturdy house that can survive an earthquake—and still have Wi-Fi.

What gets me excited? The challenge of turning something vague like “I think this should work” into “Wow, this actually works!” I’m always on the lookout for smarter ways to solve problems because at the end of the day, it’s not about the fancy frameworks or the buzzwords—it’s about getting things done without needing 10 cups of coffee.

So, if you’ve got a problem, I’ve got a solution. It might take a bit of head-scratching and a couple of “aha!” moments, but rest assured, we’ll get there.
